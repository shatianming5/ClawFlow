# ClawFlow

**A Lightweight Agent Runtime for Next-Generation Personal AI Agents**

> 让智能体从能回答走向能执行、能记忆、能恢复、能协作、能治理。

ClawFlow is a lightweight **Agent Runtime / AgentOS Kernel** prototype for building next-generation personal AI agents. It is not a ChatGPT API wrapper and not a folder of isolated demo scripts. It provides a reusable infrastructure layer for **Workflow Orchestration**, **Checkpoint & Resume**, **Tool Sandbox**, **Permission Governance**, **Memory Layer**, **Observability**, **Trace Replay**, **Plugin Registry**, **MCP-like Connector**, **RAG Module**, **Event Bus**, **Scheduler**, **Benchmark & Evaluation**, and **Multi-agent Collaboration**.

This repository is packaged for GitHub with Apache-2.0 licensing, issue templates, pull request template, CI workflow, Docker deployment, generated screenshots, benchmark artifacts, OpenAPI schema, release archive, publish readiness checker and complete report/PPT deliverables.

## Why ClawFlow is not just demos

- Example Applications are validat

## Framework capability mapping
- Runtime: planner, executor, tool calling, checkpoint, resume.
- Governance: risk-level policy, approval events, audit log.
- Observability: run table, structured trace events, replay export.
- Applications: downstream tasks must use the unified Runtime instead of isolated demo scripts.
